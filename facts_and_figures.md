The main facts and figures of the talk are explained below.

1. _This (20 gigatonnes of carbon) is roughly what we emitted before 1900._
For this figure, and most of the other carbon emissions figures, I used the [Community Emissions Data System](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS). This dataset provides carbon emissions (i.e. CO2 emissions) broken down by sector, year and country. I computed the global cumulative carbon emissions before 1900 to be roughly 11 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC). However, when I computed the global cumulative carbon emissions from 1750 to 2014, I found the total to be only 410 GtC, which is about 75% of the figure of 545 GtC quoted in [1]. I assumed that CEDS does not include all sources of land use change emissions and artificially inflated all cumulative emissions computed from CEDS by a factor of 1.33 so that they match. This includes the figures given below. This gives a figure of around 15 GtC which I simply rounded up to 20 GtC (5 GtC is well within the margin of uncertainty of total cumulative emissions). One 2x2 block of duplo therefore represents 20 GtC.

2. _This is roughly what we emitted between 1900 and 2000._
As above, I used data from CEDS and computed the (scaled, as described above) cumulative emissions as 373 GtC. Rounded, this gives 19 2x2 duplo blocks.

3. _Finally, this is what we emitted in the last 19 years._
For the years 2000-2014, I computed the emissions from CEDS, as above and with the scaling factor, to be 167 GtC. However, the dataset does not contain data for the years 2015-2018. For these four years I assumed an average emissions of 11 GtC/year, making 211 GtC in total, or around 10 2x2 duplo blocks.
