The main facts and figures of the talk are explained below.

1. _In the 19th century, we emitted half a block [of CO₂]._
For this figure, and most of the other carbon emissions figures, I used the [Community Emissions Data System](https://github.com/JGCRI/CEDS). This dataset provides carbon emissions broken down by sector, year and country, which I converted to CO₂ emissions by multiplying by a factor of 3.667. I computed the global cumulative carbon emissions before 1900 (which I assume to be almost entirely emitted in the 19th century) to be roughly 41 gigatonnes of CO₂ (GtCO₂). I computed the global cumulative carbon emissions from 1750 to 2014 to be 1505 GtCO₂. Adding the estimated emissions for 2015, 2016 and 2017 (40 GtCO₂ per year [1]) gives a figure of 1625 GtCO₂. This is about 74% of the figure of 2200 GtCO₂ quoted in [1]. I assumed that CEDS does not include all sources of land use change emissions and artificially inflated all cumulative emissions computed from CEDS by a factor of 1.35 so that they match. This includes the figures given below. This gives a figure of around 60 GtCO₂ for the 19th century which I simply rounded up to 75 GtCO₂ (15 GtCO₂ is well within the margin of uncertainty of total cumulative emissions). One 4x2 block of Duplo therefore represents 150 GtCO₂ and half a block is 75 GtCO₂.

2. _In the 20th century, as industrialisation accelerated and spread around the world, we emitted 9 and a half blocks._
As above, I used data from CEDS and computed the (scaled, as described above) cumulative emissions as 1390 GtCO₂. Rounded, this gives 9.5 4x2 Duplo blocks.

3. _And in the 21st century, we're only 20 years in and we've already emitted 5 blocks._
For the years 2000-2014, I computed the emissions from CEDS, as above and with the scaling factor, to be 622 GtCO₂. However, the dataset does not contain data for the years 2015-2018. For these four years I assumed an average emissions of 40 GtCO₂/year [1], making 782 GtCO₂ in total, or around 5 4x2 Duplo blocks.

4. _Leaving us with this, only three blocks [450 GtCO₂] worth of CO2 emissions._
The remaining carbon budget to 1.5°C is notoriously difficult to estimate. Here, we use the estimated budget from [2] of 650 GtCO₂ from (presumably January) 2015 onwards, which we convert to January 2019 onwards by subtracting 40 GtCO₂ for each of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. This gives 490 GtCO₂, or around 3 4x2 Duplo blocks.

5. _Removing just one block's worth of CO₂ from the atmosphere is estimated to cost around 12 trillion pounds._
It's hard to estimate the cost of removing CO₂ from the atmosphere as no techniques have been scaled up substantially. However $100/tCO₂ seems a reasonable ballpark figure [3]. One 4x2 block of Duplo is 150 GtCO₂, so this gives $15 trillion per block. Converted to pounds, it's about £12 trillion per block.
